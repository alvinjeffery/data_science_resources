# Data Science Resources
This is a web site for listing data science learning resources.  

*Target Audience:* Nurses & Nurse Informaticists  

*Under Construction:* This project is part of my Alliance for Nursing Informatics Emerging Leader Program. The goals of the project are to:  
- Develop a website where users can discover resources that are unique to their interests/needs  
- Connect interested users with existing data science resources  
- Raise awareness of opportunities to learn more about data science  
- Update website subscribers to new content  

The project is **not** intended to:  
- Create new resources for learning data science  

Future versions of the resource might include:  
- Discussion threads or blogs with tagged words for indexing/searching  
- Up/down vote recommended resources by users to become more organic & collaborative
